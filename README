INTRODUCTION

Everything based on the 1.1 specification for the DCPU-16 found at http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

FEATURES
 * Assembler: Assembling from the specified assembly format to binary machine code. 

POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES
 * Disassembler: Disassembling from binary machine code to the assembly format.
 * Compiler: From a Java or C-like language to the assembly format. This compiler will
     probably focus on keeping as close to the 'hardware' as possible. For example I
     don't plan to add basic types that can't be implemented efficiëntly in the
     'hardware'. This may change in the future however...
